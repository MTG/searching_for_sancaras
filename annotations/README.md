Ground-truth annotations of all sañcāra in the audio recordings were created by a professional Carnatic vocalist with 21 years of performance experience in South India. Annotations were created in Carnatic notation, known as sargam, using the software ELAN. 

As there is no definitive list of sañcāras in a given rāga, the segmentations are based on the annotator’s experience as a professional performer and student of a highly esteemed musical lineage. These annotations are therefore subjective to some degree, but have the benefit of being based on expert performer knowledge rather than on an externally imposed metric that may be irrelevant to musical concepts held by culture bearers. 

In kritis, one of the most popular compositional formats, initial phrases are repeated with variations, know as sangatis. This means that there will be initial sañcāras that are subsequently varied. These musical connections are captured by grouping the related musical material together with an "underlying sañcāra" annotation, which refers to the first occurrence and typically simplest version of the sañcāra. To reflect the hierarchical nature of plausible musical segmentations, longer phrase-level annotations that can comprise several shorter sañcāras are also created.
